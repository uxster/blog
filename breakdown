Create a blogging application that allows users to do the following:
- register an account
- login
- logout

Once logged in, a user should be able to:
- create a post
- view a list of their own posts
- view a list of everyone's posts
- view a specific post, including the comments people have made about it
- leave a comment on a post

Prior to coding, determine the following:
- your tables: what columns will they have? How will they connect to one another?
- make a diagram showing the relationships between tables.
- your routes: what routes should you have? What should each route do?
Once you are done designing your application, then proceed with coding.
Submit this document in a text file as part of your application.

Tables:
- Users (id, firstname, lastname, email, password, createdAt, updatedAt)
- Posts (id, user foreign key, title, body, createdAt, updatedAt)
- Comments (id, body of the comment, user foreign key, post foreign key, createdAt, updatedAt)

Routes:
- Home route with login/register forms
- Timeline (list of everyone's posts)
- Profile (profile information, list with own posts)
- Individual post (by ID)
